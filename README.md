I fully developed a functional e-commerce website using WordPress and Elementor Pro, ensuring a seamless user experience and efficient site management. The site is optimized for performance and SEO through key plugins like RankMath and Yoast SEO for on-page optimization, LiteSpeed Cache for caching, and Really Simple SSL for security. I integrated Google Tag Manager (GTM), Google Search Console, and Google Analytics for both server-side and browser-side tracking, ensuring detailed insights into user behavior. Additionally, I set up Facebook Pixel for precise ad targeting and conversion tracking. These tools and plugins helped enhance website speed, security, SEO rankings, and conversion rates. My comprehensive approach ensures that the website is well-optimized and ready to deliver results.
